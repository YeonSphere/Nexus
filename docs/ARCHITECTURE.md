# Nexus Browser Architecture

## Overview

Nexus Browser is built using Electron and TypeScript, providing a robust and extensible architecture for a modern web browser. This document outlines the key components and their interactions within the application.

## Main Components

1. Main Process (`src/main/main.ts`)
   - Handles the creation of browser windows
   - Manages IPC communication between processes
   - Controls application lifecycle events

2. Renderer Process
   - BrowserUI (`src/renderer/components/BrowserUI.tsx`)
     - Main container for the browser interface
   - TabManager (`src/renderer/components/TabManager.tsx`)
     - Manages the creation, deletion, and switching of tabs
   - Navigation (`src/renderer/components/Navigation.tsx`)
     - Handles URL input and navigation controls

3. Preload Script (`src/preload/preload.ts`)
   - Provides a secure bridge between renderer and main processes
   - Exposes limited API to the renderer process

4. Ad Blocker (`src/utils/adBlocker.ts`)
   - Implements ad blocking functionality
   - Intercepts and filters network requests

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the Navigation component
2. Navigation component communicates with the Main process via IPC
3. Main process handles the request and sends appropriate commands to the active webview
4. Webview loads the requested content
5. TabManager updates the tab information based on the loaded content
6. BrowserUI reflects the changes in the user interface

## Extension System

The extension system is not yet implemented. Future plans include:
- Creating an API for extensions to interact with browser functionality
- Implementing a sandboxed environment for running extensions
- Developing a system for managing and updating extensions

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a more robust ad-blocking system with customizable filters
2. Develop a sync system for user data across devices
3. Improve performance through better memory management and tab suspension
4. Implement a built-in password manager
5. Add support for progressive web apps (PWAs)
6. Enhance privacy features with fingerprint protection and VPN integration
7. Create a user-friendly theme system for customization
