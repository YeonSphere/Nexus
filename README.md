## Important Update

We have shifted our focus to a new implementation to better serve our users. This README contains information about the current, actively developed version of Nexus Browser.

## Disclaimer

This browser is still in development and is not currently supported by official paid development teams. As a result, certain features may not work as expected up to 30% of the time or more. Please submit issues for bug fixes or feature requests, or join the Discord and contact @CEO or @founder to chat with the main developer and owner.

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to improve the Nexus Browser.
